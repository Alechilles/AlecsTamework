# Architecture Overview

This document is a high-level map of how Alec's Tamework is organized and where to make changes safely.

## Core concepts
- Tamework is a framework mod supplying reusable NPC actions/sensors/components plus asset-driven runtime systems.
- Two layers: asset layer (NPC templates/items/particles/config assets) and plugin layer (components, actions, sensors, services, systems).
- Runtime is intentionally decomposed into orchestrators + focused services (selection, validation, persistence, relocation, UI view-models, feedback).

## Major subsystems
- NPC action/sensor/filter builder registration (`TameworkNpcBuilderRegistrar`)
- Optimized interaction pipeline (`TwInteractionConfig` + `TameworkInteract`)
- Hook bridge (`TriggerNpcHook` + `TameworkHook`)
- Companion progression (`TwHappinessConfig`, `TwNeedsConfig`, `TwBreedingConfig`, `TwTraitConfig`, lifecycle/attachment sync)
- Role-scoped companion policy (`TwCompanionConfig`) with global fallback
- Spawner item runtime (`TwSpawnerConfig` + `TameworkSpawn` + spawner services)
- Naming item runtime (`TwNameItemConfig` + `TameworkNameNpc` + naming services)
- Command item runtime (`TwCommandItemConfig` + `TameworkCommand` + command services)
- Command relocation/death snapshot pipeline (`CommandNpcRelocationService`, `CommandLinkedNpcDeathService`, on-load relocation system)
- Linked companions panel + command radial UI (mode/sort/filter/group management + per-row actions)
- Coop policy overlays (`TwCoopConfig`)
- Asset-set gates and tranquilizer recipe visibility reconciliation (`TwGlobalConfig.AssetSets`)
- Metrics telemetry bootstrap + dependency forwarding (`TameworkHStatsIntegration`)

## Key behaviors
- `TameworkInteract` resolves one config and executes the first enabled matching entry.
- Interaction flow is split across resolver/selector/effect helpers for maintainability.
- `TwInteractionConfig` supports preset interactions (`Tame`, `Feed`, `Harvest`, `Mount`, `ModeCycle`, `Breed`) and custom requirement/effect combinations.
- Shared progression state persists via happiness/needs/breeding/traits/life-stage/attachments components and is restored across capture/spawn + death/respawn flows.
- Command tools persist linked NPC metadata, active/inactive status, panel preferences, and group metadata directly on the item.
- Linked panel supports both linked and nearby modes, plus sort/filter/group assignment and group manager flows.
- Ownership/damage behavior resolves effective policy through `TwCompanionConfig` with `TwGlobalConfig` fallback.
